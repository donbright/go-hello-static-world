# Hello World using Go and Statically-linked C library

This program prints "Hello World". A Go language program prints the word 
'Hello' and then it calls a statically linked C library to print 
'World'. It uses the CMake build system to take care of many details.

This is a fork of shadowmint's go-hello-static-world project

### Usage

To build and run, copy/paste these commands into a terminal:
   
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
    make
    ./bin/hello

### Status

This is a basic exploration and learning tool. It is not intended for 
any fancy use. See file LICENSE-2.0 for more info.

### Design

The source tree is layed out as follows:

    src/hello/hello.go       # main go package
    src/bridge/bridge.go.in  # template, used to create 'glue' .go package
    src/c/world.c            # c code. all c code lives under 'c' path
    src/c/world.h            # c header
    CMakeLists.txt           # Cmake build file

As you can see, this is a sort of 'hybrid' Go project layout. It 
has subdirs under 'src' for Go packages. But it also has c code and
a Cmake build file.

During the cmake && make process, Cmake & go's builder will go through 
the following steps:

    Create bridge .go file from the bridge.go.in template
    Create c library (.a/.lib) file from c source code
    Call 'go install' to create main executable file, statically linked

The resulting binary tree will hopefully be as follows:

    build/bin/hello          # executable file generated by Go's builder
    build/lib/libworld.a     # statically linkable C library
    build/src/bridge.go      # "bridge" generated by cmake process
    build/cmake*             # usual Cmake generated files (cache, etc)
    build/Makefile           # cmake-generated, builds C lib & runs 'go install'
    build/pkg/machine/bridge.a # bridge library generated by 'go install'

Running ./bin/hello should produce output like this:

    Hello (Invoking c statically linked library...)
    World
    (Done)

### How to get more debug info of the build process

Set your environment variable VERBOSE to 1. This will enable the '-x' 
flag in Go as well as the VERBOSE option to 'make'.

    export VERBOSE=1 # bash shell
    setenv VERBOSE 1 # csh shell
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
    make
    ./bin/hello

### Running 'go build' afterwards (GOBIN, GOPATH, etc)

To rebuild all the C and Go code, you can use the generated shell commmand:

    ./make.sh

To run ordinary 'go' commands, you will have to set up the GOBIN and 
GOPATH environment variables. The CMakeLists.txt generates .sh scripts to 
help with this. Run one depending on your shell:

    . ./setenv.sh          # for bash/sh/dash shell (typical shell on Linux)
    source ./setenv.csh    # for csh shell (typical shell on BSD)

Now you should be able to run go commands:

    go build hello         # build the go program

The bridge .go.in -> .go process may be a little funky and sometimes require
a full re-run of 'cmake' on some occasions.
 
### On the static C glue of bridge.go.in and bridge.go

The magic static glue of the bridge file works using 'cgo' as follows:

bridge.go.in has two lines like this:

    // #cgo CFLAGS: ${CFLAGS}
    // #cgo LDFLAGS: ${LDFLAGS}

bridge.go, generated by CmakeLists.txt, has two lines like this:

    // #cgo CFLAGS: -I/tmp/go-hello-static-world/src/c
    // #cgo LDFLAGS: -L/tmp/go-hello-static-world/build/lib -lworld

### How do you know if a file is really statically linked?

ldd and file can help you

    don@serebryanya[build]$ ldd ./bin/hello 
	not a dynamic executable
    don@serebryanya[build]$ file bin/hello 
        bin/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), 
        statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, 

### Windows(TM)

Untested in this fork.

### Differences from shadowmint's original code

    1. remove usage of separate cmake BindConfig.txt file
    2. put all generated files under 'build' directory (bridge.go)
    3. move call of 'go build' into cmake process (go install)
    4. rearrange and simplify directory structure
    5. link everything statically in the binary, not just the C code

### Why do this?

When transforming a program from C to Go, where the program is
50,000 lines of C, it may be easier to transform it in small pieces
and of course some C libraries may not be transformable ever. 

Static linking is a nice way to distribute code to others without them
having to worry about library versions and installing extra packages. 

Thanks for reading. Thanks shadowmint.
