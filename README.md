# Hello World using Go and Statically-linked C library

This program prints "Hello World". A go language program prints the word 
'Hello' and then it calls a statically linked C library to print 
'World'.

This is a fork of shadowmint's go-hello-static-world project

## Design

The source tree is layed out as follows:

    src/hello/hello.go       # main go package
    src/bridge/bridge.go.in  # template, will generate 'glue' .go package
    src/c/world.c            # c code all lives under 'c' path
    src/c/world.h            
    CMakeLists.txt           # Cmake build file

As you can see, this is a sort of 'hybrid' go project layout. It 
has subdirs under 'src' for go packages. But it also has c code and
a Cmake build file. To build, run the following command
   
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && VERBOSE=1 make

Cmake & go's builder will go through the following steps:

    Create bridge .go file from the bridge.go.in template
    Create c library (.a/.lib) file from c source code
    Call 'go install' to create main executable file, statically linked

The resulting binary tree will hopefully be as follows:

    build/bin/hello          # executable file generated by Go's builder
    build/lib/libworld.a     # statically linkable C library
    build/src/bridge.go      # "bridge" generated by cmake process
    build/cmake*             # usual Cmake generated files (cache, etc)
    build/Makefile           # cmake-generated, builds C lib & runs 'go install'
    build/pkg/machine/bridge.a # bridge library generated by 'go install'

Running ./bin/hello should produce output like this:

    Hello (Invoking c statically linked library...)
    World
    (Done)

## GOBIN, GOPATH, What do to do after 'make'

To rebuild the C code, just type 'make' from the command shell.

To rebuild the 'go' code, it's a bit more complicted. You will need to 
set your GOBIN and GOPATH environment variables. The values for GOBIN 
and GOPATH are printed during the cmake process. Here is an example from 
a machine where the project was git cloned under the /tmp/ directory:

    GOPATH=/tmp/go-hello-static-world/build:/tmp/go-hello-static-world
    GOBIN=/tmp/go-hello-static-world/build/bin

If you dont know how to set env variables in your shell, do a quick google
search on it and then you will be able to properly copy/paste those values.
Or fork/submit a patch to make this easier somehow.

After this you can type 'go build hello' or 'go install hello' and it should
build and link the 'bin/hello' file again. 

However if the bridge code and/or the C code changes, you will need to 
possibly rerun make and/or cmake to regenerate the C library file (.lib or .a)
and also regenerate the bridge.go glue code.
 
## On the static glue of bridge.go.in and bridge.go

The magic static glue of the bridge file works as follows:

bridge.go.in has two lines like this:

    // #cgo CFLAGS: -I${C_INCLUDE_PATH}
    // #cgo LDFLAGS: -L${C_LIBRARY_PATH} -l${C_LIBRARY_NAME}

bridge.go, generated by CmakeLists.txt, has two lines like this:

    // #cgo CFLAGS: -I/tmp/go-hello-static-world/src/c
    // #cgo LDFLAGS: -L/tmp/go-hello-static-world/build/lib -lworld

## Windows(TM)

Untested in this fork.

## Differences from shadowmint's original code

    1. remove usage of separate cmake BindConfig.txt file
    2. put all generated files under 'build' directory (bridge.go)
    3. move call of 'go build' into cmake process (go install)
    4. rearrange and simplify directory structure

## Why do this?

When transforming a program from C to Go, where the program is
50,000 lines of C, it may be easier to transform it in small pieces
and of course some C libraries may not be transformable ever. 

Static linking is a nice way to simplify the user experience. 
No dynamic libraries to worry about.

Thanks for reading. Thanks shadowmint.
